# Side-Quests
A collection of quick, small coding projects — my “Side Quests” to practice and experiment.


These are some quick and simple projects I made mostly for practice or to try out basic coding ideas.

They’re really beginner-level stuff, so don’t expect anything fancy or super polished here.

If you want to use any of these for your own projects, homework, or just to get started with coding, feel free! No strings attached.

Thanks for checking them out!
