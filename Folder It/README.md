FolderIt is a command-line tool designed for bulk file organization. Upon execution, it prompts the user to specify a folder location. Once provided, it scans the selected folder, creates subfolders corresponding to each file's name, and moves the files into their respective folders. This process simplifies the task of organizing files in bulk, eliminating the need for manual sorting.
