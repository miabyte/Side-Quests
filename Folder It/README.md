# FolderIt✨

A small tool I made to save time during bulk file organizing.
It’s simple: give it a folder, and it creates a subfolder for each file inside — then moves each file into its own matching folder. That’s it!
This comes in handy when you're working with lots of assets, product images, or anything messy.

💡 How to Use It:
Let’s say you have a folder like this:  
MyFolder  
↳ img1.png  
↳ img2.png  
↳ img3.png  
 
Run FolderIt.exe  

A little window will pop up. Paste your folder path there and press OK  

The tool will automatically create folders like this:
