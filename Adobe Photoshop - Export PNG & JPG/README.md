# Photoshop Export Script â€” miasave.jsx ðŸŒ¿
![](https://i.imgur.com/7wIpmTt.png)

I originally created this script for personal design projects. Itâ€™s a tiny helper, but incredibly useful when youâ€™re dealing with large batches of files.
Hereâ€™s what it does:
If you're working on something like MyProject.psd and run this script, it will instantly export MyProject.png (with transparency) and MyProject.jpg (in highest quality) into the same folder â€” automatically.

Sounds simple, but when youâ€™re exporting hundreds or thousands of product images, social media graphics, or thumbnails, this becomes a huge time saver.

Bonus tip:
If you turn it into a Photoshop action and assign it a shortcut key (for example, I used a side mouse button), you can export your files without even touching the keyboard.
