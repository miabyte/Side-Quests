🌸------HOW TO USE IT? ------🌸
1--Move the miasave.jsx file anywhere you want.
---Recommended:
---C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2025\Presets\Scripts

2--Open Photoshop.
3--Then go to: File > Scripts > miasave
---That’s it! It’ll export your current .psd as both .jpg and .png in the same folder.



💡------Optional: One-Click Export------💡
If you want to use this with a single key press, you can create a custom action:

1---In Photoshop, open any .psd file and go to the Actions Panel.
2---Create a new action and start recording.
3---Go to:   File > Scripts > miasave
4---Stop recording.
5---Now you can assign a shortcut key to that action.

✅ Result: Whenever you press your key, Photoshop saves both .jpg and .png with the original .psd filename — automatically.
